# The relationship between the proportion of the youth population and the number of offences in Leeds

# Backgrounds: 
# Studies have shown that there has been no general decline in crime in Western Europe since the mid-1990s, with economic crime declining but violent crime rising. Moreover, the proportion of young people in the number of offenders has risen significantly. (Aebi and Linde, 2010) Most young people are impulsive and immature, and are relatively susceptible to influences that can significantly contribute to or block socio-economic development. Therefore, regions with a high proportion of young people should be given more attention. (Sandoval Garrido, 2021) At the same time, it has also been shown that crime rates in England and Wales have fallen since 2005. This is largely due to a reduction in the youth offending population. Changes in crime rates in England and Wales are closely linked to the youth offending population. (Griffiths and Norris, 2020) The project demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between the proportion of young people and the number of crimes committed, that is, the higher the proportion of young people, the higher the number of crimes committed in the area. Therefore, a number of measures and instruments can be adopted to reduce the crime rate, such as increasing the employment rate of young people and community interventions.

# GitHub contains the following data: 
# 1.	All types of offences in Leeds in October 2021 (https://www.kaggle.com)
# 2.	Age structure of the population of Leeds in 2021 (https://www.ons.gov.uk/)
# 3.	Leeds shape file with 2021 LSOA code (https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/)

# Purpose of the code: 
# The main purpose of the code is to clean the data and generate a spatial visualisation map and a non-spatial visualisation map. Cleaning the data makes the data more credible and easier to use. The code generates a spatial visualisation and a non-spatial visualisation and modifies them, such as the colour and size of the graphs, to make them more readable and easier to understand.
